Summer of SQL Week 7 - Preppin Data 2023 Weeks 9-12

// 2023: Week 9 - Customer Bank Statements
For the Transaction Path table:
Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables
i.e. instead of Account_From it should be Account From
Filter out the cancelled transactions
Split the flow into incoming and outgoing transactions 
Bring the data together with the Balance as of 31st Jan 
Work out the order that transactions occur for each account
Hint: where multiple transactions happen on the same day, assume the highest value transactions happen first
Use a running sum to calculate the Balance for each account on each day (hint)
The Transaction Value should be null for 31st Jan, as this is the starting balance

// 2023: Week 10 Preppin Data
Aggregate the data so we have a single balance for each day already in the dataset, for each account
Scaffold the data so each account has a row between 31st Jan and 14th Feb (hint)
Make sure new rows have a null in the Transaction Value field
Create a parameter so a particular date can be selected
Filter to just this date
